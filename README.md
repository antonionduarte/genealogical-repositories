# Genealogical Repositories

*OCaml, fully functional programming project for the Languages and Programming Environments class*
*In this project we developed functions to process and make interisting queries in a special type*
*of data structure, called a Genealogical Gepository.*
*A repository is a 	list of pairs, each consisting on the identification of an individual, 
and the list of known children of the specific individual*

# Auxiliary Data Structures

*Some of the auxiliary data structures used in the project are Binary Trees, Lists and NNary Trees.*
_We use Binary Trees and NNary Trees respectively in the form of **Ancestor Trees** and **Descendants Trees**, the first storing
all the known Ancestors of a specific element, and the former all the know Descendants._

# Functions

- Height: Determines the height of a given repository.
- makeATree: Makes an ancestor tree for a specific element, on a specific repository.
- makeDTree: Makes a descendants tree for a specific element, on a specific repository.
